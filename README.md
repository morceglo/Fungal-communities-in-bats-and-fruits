## Title of project
Fungal communities in bats and fruits

## Authors
Priscila Chaverri and Gloriana Chaverri

## General info

We characterize the culture-dependent and independent fungal communities in fruits of Ficus colubrinae and in feces of Ectophylla alba to determine if passage through the digestive tract of the bats affected the total mycobiota.
